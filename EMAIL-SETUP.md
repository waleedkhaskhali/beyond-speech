cd backend
cp env.example .env
```

### Step 2: Update Email Settings in .env

Edit the `.env` file and update these email settings:

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER="your-gmail@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASS="your-app-password"

```

2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings

   - Generate password for "Mail"
   - Use this password in `EMAIL_PASS`

### Step 4: Test the Form

2. **Start the frontend**: `npm run dev`
3. **Visit**: `http://localhost:3000`
4. **Fill out the contact form** and submit
5. **Check your email** at wkhaskhalu@gmail.com

## ðŸ“‹ What Happens When Someone Submits the Form

1. **Form data** is sent to the backend API
2. **Email notification** is sent to wkhaskhalu@gmail.com with:
   - Contact details (name, email, phone)
   - Role (family/SLP/school/etc.)
   - All form responses
   - Timestamp
3. **Success message** is shown to the user
4. **Form is reset** for next submission

## ðŸŽ¯ Form Features

- **Role-based fields** that change based on user type
- **Real-time validation** 
- **Loading states** during submission
- **Success/error messages**
- **Responsive design**

## ðŸš€ Ready to Go!

Once you configure the email settings, your contact form will automatically send all submissions to your email address. No additional setup needed!

**Need help?** The form will work without email configuration - submissions will be logged to the console and saved to the database, but emails won't be sent until you set up the email credentials.
